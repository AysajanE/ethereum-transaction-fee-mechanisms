    "The process to identify if a transaction is a simple Ether transfer, Token transfer, or Smart contract interaction is not straightforward because of the versatile nature of Ethereum transactions. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Simple Ether Transfers:** These are transactions where Ether is transferred from one account to another. These transactions can be identified by checking if the `input` data field is '0x' (i.e., empty) and the `to` field is not a contract address (it doesn't have associated bytecode).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Token Transfers (ERC-20, ERC-721, etc.):** These are transactions where tokens (like USDT, DAI, etc.) are transferred. Token transfers follow a standard set of rules defined in the ERC-20 or ERC-721 specifications. One of the main methods in these specifications is `transfer(...)`. When this method is called, the `input` data field in the transaction starts with the method ID derived from the keccak256 hash of the method signature. For example, the `transfer(...)` method's ID is '0xa9059cbb'. So, you could identify ERC-20 token transfers by checking if the `input` field starts with this method ID. However, this check can yield false positives, as other contracts can use the same method ID for different purposes. Identifying ERC-721 (NFT) transfers can be more challenging, as multiple methods (`safeTransferFrom(...)`, `transferFrom(...)`, etc.) can be used to transfer tokens. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Smart Contract Interactions:** If the `input` data field is not '0x' (empty), and the `input` does not correspond to a standard ERC-20 or ERC-721 token transfer, you can classify the transaction as a smart contract interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that these checks provide a rough classification of the transactions but aren't perfect. For example, they don't account for cases where a single transaction involves both Ether and token transfers or multiple types of contract interactions. Further, they don't cover all token standards (like ERC-1155, which allows for both fungible and non-fungible tokens).\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, if you need a precise classification of transaction types, you might need to employ more sophisticated methods, such as analyzing the bytecode of contracts, tracking the state changes of known contracts, or using specialized services or libraries that provide this kind of analysis.\n",
