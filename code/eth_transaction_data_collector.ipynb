    "The process to identify if a transaction is a simple Ether transfer, Token transfer, or Smart contract interaction is not straightforward because of the versatile nature of Ethereum transactions. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Simple Ether Transfers:** These are transactions where Ether is transferred from one account to another. These transactions can be identified by checking if the `input` data field is '0x' (i.e., empty) and the `to` field is not a contract address (it doesn't have associated bytecode).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Token Transfers (ERC-20, ERC-721, etc.):** These are transactions where tokens (like USDT, DAI, etc.) are transferred. Token transfers follow a standard set of rules defined in the ERC-20 or ERC-721 specifications. One of the main methods in these specifications is `transfer(...)`. When this method is called, the `input` data field in the transaction starts with the method ID derived from the keccak256 hash of the method signature. For example, the `transfer(...)` method's ID is '0xa9059cbb'. So, you could identify ERC-20 token transfers by checking if the `input` field starts with this method ID. However, this check can yield false positives, as other contracts can use the same method ID for different purposes. Identifying ERC-721 (NFT) transfers can be more challenging, as multiple methods (`safeTransferFrom(...)`, `transferFrom(...)`, etc.) can be used to transfer tokens. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Smart Contract Interactions:** If the `input` data field is not '0x' (empty), and the `input` does not correspond to a standard ERC-20 or ERC-721 token transfer, you can classify the transaction as a smart contract interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that these checks provide a rough classification of the transactions but aren't perfect. For example, they don't account for cases where a single transaction involves both Ether and token transfers or multiple types of contract interactions. Further, they don't cover all token standards (like ERC-1155, which allows for both fungible and non-fungible tokens).\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, if you need a precise classification of transaction types, you might need to employ more sophisticated methods, such as analyzing the bytecode of contracts, tracking the state changes of known contracts, or using specialized services or libraries that provide this kind of analysis."

The `get_transaction_count` function is used to get the number of transactions sent from an address up to a certain block. After finding the first usage block of each address, the script adds a new column 'address_age' to the data, which represents the age of the address at the time of each transaction.\n",

This script uses a `ThreadPoolExecutor` to run multiple block scanning tasks simultaneously, which should significantly speed up the process if you're running it on a machine with multiple CPU cores. However, the maximum number of concurrent tasks is limited by the number of CPU cores in your machine."

    "\n",
    "Due to the global nature of Ethereum transactions, the \"time of day\" variable could have different implications for users in different time zones, and this could indeed introduce complexity and potentially confounding effects into the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there may still be value in including a \"time of day\" variable, even in a global context, for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Network Effects**: Blockchain networks like Ethereum may experience periods of higher and lower congestion, which could align with certain times of day, despite global usage. For example, if a substantial proportion of Ethereum users are based in a particular region (say, North America or East Asia), then the network might be busier during the waking hours of that region.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Market Activity**: Cryptocurrency markets operate 24/7 and market activity (trading volume, price volatility, etc.) can vary significantly across different times of the day, potentially influencing user behavior. For example, users might be more likely to engage in DeFi transactions during periods of high market activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Behavioral Patterns**: Regardless of the global nature of Ethereum, there might be common daily behavioral patterns. For example, users might be more active during their daytime and less active during their nighttime, and these patterns could aggregate up to observable patterns in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, given the global nature, it may be advisable to construct the \"time of day\" variable in a way that captures potential global effects. For example, you could split the day into fewer, larger chunks (like morning, afternoon, evening, and night), or analyze this variable carefully in your exploratory analysis to understand its distribution and potential impacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another approach might be to construct a variable that captures the \"local time of day\" for each transaction, assuming you can infer or have information about the geographic location of each user (which could introduce privacy issues and may not be feasible). But again, these are more complex and may not necessarily offer a better representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, including \"time of day\" in your initial model does not obligate you to keep it in your final model. If exploratory analysis or preliminary model results suggest it's not meaningful or is causing issues, you can always exclude it in later iterations of your modeling process.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, the \"time of day\" could potentially be a meaningful variable in your analysis, but its use and interpretation require careful consideration due to the global nature of Ethereum usage."

    "Given the global nature of Ethereum, a simple division of a day into distinct periods based on a specific time zone may not be the most representative. However, a potential solution could be to divide the day into a number of periods that are likely to capture significant changes in activity. For instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Daytime**: 06:00 to 17:59\n",

    "If it's possible to incorporate additional information, such as the geographic distribution of Ethereum users or the times of day that tend to see the most network activity, this could be used to refine these periods further.\n",
